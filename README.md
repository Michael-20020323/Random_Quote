# Production
# Adding the Develop Branch to the Repository
# Random_Quote
# I created the public repository in GitHub and then added the source code of the RandomQuote program to the local folder on my computer where I cloned the repository.

# Problem-Solving approach

My program is set out to provide the user with a inspirational quote, whenever they run it.
I use this program just to get an extra boost of energy for the day.

I thought of this idea because there are a lot of people that are very intelligent, and that said wise words that I think people should hear.
I went on Google to find some beautiful quotes to add to my program.
I started coding the program, which was not a difficult task since the program uses the random library, and when it runs it chooses a random quote out of the list that I created to display 
the quote to the user.
